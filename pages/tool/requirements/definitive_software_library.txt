^ ID ^ [[:general:glossary:glossary_introduction#MoSCoW (BABOK)|MoSCoW]] ^ Security ^
| 4.1.1 | M | As an Security User I want the tool to support integration with Active Directory for authorization So that the tool meets security group policy |
| 4.1.2	| M | As a User I want the Enterprise Artifact Repository to Audit who created and when So that I can easily identify who created artifacts in the event of a change breach.|
| 4.1.3	| M | As a Dev/Test/Prod Manager I want the Enterprise Artifact Repository to Audit who modified a state transition (promotion) and when So that I can easily identify which user has promoted an artifact. |
| 4.1.4	| M | As a Security User I want to ensure that only Developers can create artifacts and once created  they become immutable to all roles So that Integrity of artifacts is achieved throughout the SDLC process. |
| 4.1.5 | M | As a Security User  I want the tool to support fine grained security permissions So that I can restrict access as required including specific artifacts and assets |
| 4.1.6 | M | As Security Architecture I have non functional requirements addressing security and audit So that the tool is compliant for NAB. |

^ ID ^ [[:general:glossary:glossary_introduction#MoSCoW (BABOK)|MoSCoW]] ^ Reliability ^
| 4.2.1 | M | As a User I want to ensure that the system is backed up as per NAB policies So that in the event of corruption or loss of hardware, I can recover my repository |
| 4.2.2 | M | As a User I want the system to be available 99.95% up-time including DR So that I can support the business with software delivery always. |
| 4.2.3 | M | As a User I want a system that is proven to be reliable and is demonstrated in use across other Enterprises So that all teams can use the tool effectively to support the business. |

^ ID ^ [[:general:glossary:glossary_introduction#MoSCoW (BABOK)|MoSCoW]] ^ Maintenance ^
| 4.3.1 | M | Ability to clean up and delete one or many artefacts that are no longer required as long as they have not been deployed to production |

^ ID ^ [[:general:glossary:glossary_introduction#MoSCoW (BABOK)|MoSCoW]] ^ Maintenance ^
| 4.4.1 | M | As a User I want basic first level support So that assistance can be given to on board and resolve issues. |
| 4.4.2 | M | As a Support User I want Second level from the creator of the tool So that incidents/upgrades and maintenance can be handled effectively |
| 4.4.3 | M | As a User I want a basic user guide So that I can self service my actions in the system |

^ ID ^ [[:general:glossary:glossary_introduction#MoSCoW (BABOK)|MoSCoW]] ^ Traceability ^
| 4.5.1 | M | As a User I want to be able to relate an artifact to the source code that produced it So that I can reproduce the artifact from source code |
| 4.5.2 | M | As a Legal User I want to be able to identify open source artifacts used within the repository So that I can identify any legal implications with use of these libraries easily |
| 4.5.3 | M | As a Dev/Test/Prod Manager I want the tool to support identifying and changing of state transitions (promotions) So that identification of what stage through the SDLC life cycle the package has progressed. *Note: This is not Segregation of Duties, but SDLC traceability. * State Transitions at a minimum should be �Dev�, �Test�, �Ready-Release� and �Production�. |
| 4.5.4 | N | As a Dev/Test/Prod Manager I want the flexibility to add extra  values to the state transition (promotion) So that I can track in more detail the SDLC life cycle. i.e Test, UAT, Sys Test |
| 4.5.5 | M | As a Dev/Test/Prod Manager I want the tool to support rules based exception alerting So that an Alert Notification is send to a specific group when an exception promotion transition occurs. * This is to support process breaks and better practice education. E.g. when a non-Tester promotes from Test to Ready Release an exception notification should be issued. |
| 4.5.6 | S | As a user I want to be able to uniquely identify by content (fingerprint) any artifact the tool has stored And retain this identify even if the artifact has been deleted So that I can tell if an object has ever been entered for deployment |
| 4.5.7 | M | As a Test Manager I want the the tool to support storing the Production Change number associated with the release of the artifact into production So that I can easily identify all artifacts related to the Change Control Process.  |

^ ID ^ [[:general:glossary:glossary_introduction#MoSCoW (BABOK)|MoSCoW]] ^ Scalability ^
| 4.7.1 | M | Geographically distant teams must be able to use the tool with minimal impact to above performance |
| 4.7.2 | M | The tool should perform well when copying artifacts to the repository (regardless of the number of files, size of individual files, or total size of artifacts) |

^ ID ^ [[:general:glossary:glossary_introduction#MoSCoW (BABOK)|MoSCoW]] ^ Integration ^
| 4.8.1 | M | As any user I want there to be a web API that is easily accessible So that I can integrate or script functionality allowed by my role |
| 4.8.2 | M | As any user  I want there to be a web GUI So that I can perform actions required by my role |
| 4.8.3 | M | As a Developer I want the ability to store and retrieve one or many artifacts related to a version through the Web GUI So that I can make available artifacts when not using a Continuous Integration tool. |
| 4.8.4 | M | As a user I want the ability for the repository tool to integrate directly via plugins to common industry tools such as Jenkins and Maven So that operations for storing and retrieving are easily handled. |
| 4.8.5 | M | As a user I want to be able to access artifacts from all system platforms (Windows / Linux / Solaris / Mac ) So that I have access to artifacts to perform either manual or automated deployments |
