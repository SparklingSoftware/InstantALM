===== A =====

==== American National Standards Institute (ANSI) ====

It also coordinates the American standards with the global standards so that the American products can be used internationally.

===== B =====

==== Business Case (PRINCE2) ====

In the PRINCE2 project management methodology, the Business Case is the 'driver' of the project. It is used to decide from beforehand if the project is a worthwhile investment. The Business Case is used to justify the investment of time, money and resources into a project by highlighting the benefits from the project. The Business Case is made of the eight key sections: Reasons; Options; Benefits; Risks; Costs; Timescale; Investment Appraisal; and Evaluation.

==== Business Relationship Management (BRM) ====

It is an approach for understanding, defining, and supporting a range of inter-business activities that are related to the provision of knowledge and services via networks, with a focus on the emergence of online networks as the primary medium for conducting business relationships. It is aimed at providing a complete and holistic model of business relationships and business relationship value over time, so as to make the different aspects of business relationships both explicit and measurable.


===== C =====

==== Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) ====

It is a process improvement approach where the goal is to help organizations improve their performance. CMMI can be useful for guiding process improvements across a project, a division, or an entire organization. CMMI can help to integrate the traditionally separate organizational functions with set process improvement goals and priorities, thus providing guidance for quality processes and a point of reference for appraising the current processes.

It is aimed at helping an IT service provider in effectively managing its budgeting, accounting and charging requirements. The ITIL Financial Management has the following sub-processes: ‘Financial Management Support’; ‘Financial Planning’; ‘Financial Analysis and Reporting’; and ‘Service Invoicing’.


==== Information Security Management System (ITIL) ====

The ITIL-process Security Management lays down the structured position of information security in the management organisation.

The main objective of information security is to protect the information assets against risks and to maintain their value to the organization.

IEEE is one of the leading standards making organizations and its standards relate to a broad range of industries such as, power and energy, Information Technology, biomedical and healthcare, transportation, nanotechnology, telecommunications and information assurance.

==== IP ====

See [[:general:glossary#Improvement Proposal|Improvement Proposal]]

==== International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000 standards ====

The ISO 9000 family of standards pertain to quality management systems and they are designed in order to help the organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders. 

==== ISO ====

See [[:general:glossary#International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000 standards|International Organization for Standardization]]

==== Iterative Software Development Process (as in RUP) ====

It is a software development process that prescribes the development of initially small but ever-larger portions of a software project for helping those who are involved in the discovery of important issues early before the problems or faulty assumptions can lead to disaster. It commences with an initial planning stage and it ends with the deployment of the cyclic interactions in between the stages. 

==== IT Service Management (ITSM) ====

It is a discipline for managing the Information Technology systems that are based on the customer's perspective of the contribution of IT to business. ITSM is process-focused and it thus it is aligned with the process improvement frameworks (such as, TQM, Six Sigma, business process management, CMMI).

==== Project Brief (PRINCE2) ====

It is a description and an outline for what the project is attempting to achieve and the business justifications behind a project implementation

==== Project Initiation Documentation (PRINCE2) ====

It bundles the information that was acquired throughout the Starting up a Project and Initiating a Project processes in a PRINCE2 controlled project environment. The Project Initiation Document, or PID, is a PRINCE2 term that means the plan of the overall approach in project management.

===== Q =====

===== R =====

==== Rational Method Composer (RUP) ====

A flexible process management platform having a set of comprehensive tooling and rich process libraries to help the companies implement effective processes for successful software and IT projects. It features more than 100 selectable and customizable process guidance, (including RUP), for solving the common problems in business, management or software development.

==== Rational Process Library (RUP) ====

==== Satellite Communities / SPII / SEPG ====

These are the communities that have implemented parts of "Share" and are using it to improve their software delivery processes. They can both be collaborating with the Global ALM Community to contribute to the Global ALM Standards Library, or they can download a local clone of the Global ALM Standards Libraries and tailor it for their own use without contributing back to the global community.

The communities can be within an organisation or across in the form of after-hour sessions for instance.

==== Standard ====

It is really hard to define what a standard is, but here are a couple of examples of standards. 

  * Process maps
  * Role descriptions
  * Templates
  * Job aids
  * Tools selections
  * Link to external content

As you can see, the types are quite diverse, so the definition is pretty much: "Whatever the communities agree on".
